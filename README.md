# Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This Python project is designed for web scraping tasks. It utilizes the `requests` library for making HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content. The goal of this script is to scrape content from the website [zinnov.com](https://zinnov.com/) and save it locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```shell
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the web scraping script:

1. Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd web-scraping-project
```

3. Run the script:

```shell
python main.py
```

The script will start scraping the website and save the HTML content of each page in a directory named `scraped_data`.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the following variables in `main.py`:

- `base_url`: The starting URL for scraping.
- `download_dir`: The directory where scraped data will be saved.
- `user_agent`: The user-agent string used for HTTP requests.
